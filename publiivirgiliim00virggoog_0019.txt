’ ment of an illustrious career, and the harbinger of an immortal day.

Pollio, who entertained a sineere friendship sor Virgil, and was well qualified
to forma correct estimate of his talents and acquirentem, becoming acquaint-
ed with his case, recommended him to Maecenas, who was then at Rome, and
held the highest place of honor and confidence with his priuce. The friend of
Pollio found also a friend in Maecenas. He laid his ease before Augustus, and
by his influenee with bis prince, obtained the restoration of his estate. Virgil,
st this time, probably was about 99 years of age. He immediately returned
with the edict of the emperor for the restoration of his farm, which had fallen
into the hands of one Areus, a centurion ; but he was resisted and ill-treated by
the new possessor, and forced to swim over the Mincius to save bis life. This
cruel heatment is the subject of the nrnth Eclogue.

He went ι’ second time to Rome upon the subject. But it is probable he
never aster resided upon his estate. A wider field now opened before him ; and
he made the seat os the empire the place of his residenee. Here his acquaint-
ance ond friendship were sought by the most distinguished men ; and the favorits
of the Muses became also the favorite of Augustus.

With a view to compliment his prince, and to express the happy state of the
etEpilrle 'under his adminismlion'fllihilisaidt'hhe comiolid tlie following distich.

Augustus was highly pleased with the compliment paid to hin} and the deli·
cate manner in which it was expressed 3 and he desired to lind out the author.
Virgil’s modesty and diflidenee presented him from making an avowal. At
length, one Bathyllus, a poet of inferior merit, had the hardihood to claim to be
the author. The emperor riehly rewarded him. This greatly mortified our
poet, who wrote the same lines upon the gnte of the palace, with the following
one under them:

Hos ago versiculos feei, tulit altar honores:
together with the beginning of another line in these words,

Sic vos non vobis,

repeated three times. Augustus wished to find the author; and as the surest
way of doing it, demanded that the lines should be finished. Several attempta
were made without effect. Bathyllus was not able to do it; which led to a
suspicion of his imposture. At last Virgil finished them,and thus avowed him-
self the author of the previous distich. The lines are as follow:

Sic vos non vobis nidificatis aveas

Sic voa 'non vobis vellera fertis oven
ο Sic vos non vobis mellificatis apes:

Sic vos non vobis sertis tratre boves.

transmotae the impostor, and covered him with ridicule aad contempt.
