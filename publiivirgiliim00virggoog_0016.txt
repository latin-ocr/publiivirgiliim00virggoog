Gnarum,

'lhe very favorable opinion that many of you have expressed, of the plan
ffiexffigpln of this Edition (ff tha saorla os Virgil, claime my respecttirl
ow ents.

Every attempt to facilitate the acquisition of classical literature will,l arn
permaded, meet your approbation3 Ι shall, therefore, offer no apology for
adding this new edition to the many others, already before the public.

Soon aster l commenced the instruction of youth, l became sensible of tho
snpropriety of the use of the editions of Virgil, then in our schools. Those of
Ruaeus and Davidson were generally, if not exclusively, read; both equally
objectionable, tha former by affonling too little aid to the student in the illus·
tration of tha text, the latter hy affording him too much. lt was at this early
period that Ι formed the plan of the present edition. Except the two last books
of the AEneid, it was finished in tha year tata, as you will perceive by the date
of sevam} of the recommendatione. Since which time, they have been corn·
pleted. and the whole carehrlly revised and greatly improved. 'l'bis delay in
the publication gave me a further opportunity to become acquainted with the
tants of studente, especially in the early course of study, and to collect the
opinions of teachers upon this subject. That opinion hus uniformly been in
favor os my plaa; which takes a middle course between the opposite extremes
of athrrding too little, and too much assistance to the student.

The partial ordo is designed to assist him in themora intricate parts of the
text3 and where recourse otherwise must be had to the toacher. The notes
aad explanatione are eopious. They embrace whatever was deemed necessary
to elucidata the poet, and to lead the youthful mind to relish his beauties. Some
of the more difficult passages Ι have translated3 and, in general, where a word
isuscd out of its common acceptation, l have given its sense and meaning in
that particular place: and where commentators are not agreed upon tho nican-
ing of a word or phrase, l have given their respective opinions. ln the text, l
hare adopted the reading of Hcyne, except in a few instances, where the com·
raon reading appeared preferable.

To the Bucolica, Georgica, and AEneid, Ι have given, in the first instance, a
general introduction; and to each Eclogue, and book of the Georgica and
AEneid,a summary or particular introduction: so that the student, knoning
beforehand the subject, and anticipating the beautics and excellences of the
poet. will proceed with ease and pleasure, and in a manner catch his spith-

To escb l have added a number of questions, to be asked by the toacher, mh
