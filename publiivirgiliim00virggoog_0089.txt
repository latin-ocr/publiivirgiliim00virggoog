P. VIRGlLIl MARONIS

Haud facilem esse viam, voluit, primusque

Movit agros, curis acuens mortalia corda
Nec torpere gravi passus sua regna veteri
Ante Jovern nulli subigebant arva colonit
Nec signare quidem, aut partiri limite aar
Fas erat: in medium quaerebant: ipsaqu
Omnia liberius, nullo poscente, serebat.
Illa malum virus serpentibus addidit auis,
Praedamque lupos jussit, pontumque move
’ Mellaque decussit soliis, ignemque remor
Et passim rivis currentia vina repressit:
Ut varias usus meditando extunderet arta
Paulatim, et sulcis frumenti quaereret her
Et silicis venis abstrusum excuderet ignei
