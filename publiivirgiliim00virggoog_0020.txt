About this time, at the suggestion of Pollio, Virgil commenced writing his
&logum which occupied him three years. The fret, was written to express
his gratitudo to his prince for the restoration of ‚his fonds. This he did in so
delicate and modest a manner, that it raised hirn gieatly in the estimation of
his friends and countrymen: and the poet conferred agrester favor upon
Augustus, by immortulizing this act of his beneficence, than he did by restoring
to him his lands The others were written upon various occasions, and for
various purposes.

The Eclogues were extremely popular. So well were they received, that
they were several times repeated upon the stage. Cicero ,upon hearing lhem,
was so much pleased, that he did not hesitate to say of the author: Magnae spes
alteru Romoe, which words the poet afterwards introduced' 1nto the twelflh book
of the AEneid, applied toliilus. Virgil may be considered the first who intro·
duced pastorals among the Romans. lt is afact worthy of notice, that he was
the introducet, and at the sarno tirne the perfector, of this kind of waiting. All
succeeding poets have taken him as their model, and found the sur-est way to
success to be, to copy his beauties. Itis true, he was much indebted to
Theocritus, who was the first pastoral writer of eminencc among the Greeks.
hut he followed him with judgment, and improved upon him so much in ·
correctness of teste, in purity of thought, and delicacy of expression, that we
lose sight of the original. So much was he esteemed, that all classes of per-
sons crowded to see him, wirenever he appeared in public ; and on entering the
theatro, the people rose up to do lrim-reverence, no less than to Augustus
himself.

During the civil ware, agriculture had been much neglected: and so gene·
rel had the distress become on that account, that serious apprehensions were
entertained for the peace of ltaly. All classes of people began to murmur, and
to cast the blame upon Augustus, and his administration. ln this state of
things, it occurred to Maecenas, that the most effectual method of averting the
impending evils, and of restoring peace to the people, and confidence in the
adrninistration, was to revive the agricultural interests of the country> For this
purpose, he desired Virgil to write a treatise upon agriculture. He well knew
co person was better qualified for a work of this kind. Ile possessed an
extensive knowledo „eof the subject, acorrect mate, and could euliven it with
the charms of poe .ic numbers, and he already possessed the confidence and
affectione of his countrymen.

Aster a short respite, he ent'ered upon the work. That he might be less
mter-rupted in its prosecution, he retired from Rome to Naples, a city more
tranquil, and, at the same time, more healthy. ln this pleasant retreat removed
from the bustle of the capital, the antrigue of courts, and the Jarring interests of
politice, he composed the Georgica-a poem, the most perfect and finished of
any composition in the Latin language. He spent seven years in the viork.
'l'he public expectation was raised high; but tt was far surpassed: and Virgil
conferred agreater blessing upon his country, thanis, inthe field, he had oh
maed the most splendid victory over its enemies.

'l'he Georgica were every where well received, and Italy soon assumeda
flourishing appearance The people found themselves rn the enjoyment of
peace, plenty, and domestic happiness. The poet dedicated the work to has
friend Maecenas, a statesman distinguished equally for his love of literature and
sciense, the correctness of his politica, and the wisdom of his councils.

Virgil was now forty years of age. At this time, he found himself 1n the pos-
session of a large estate ,chiefly from the liberality of his prinae. His fame was
coextensive with the empire, and the lovers of the muse courted his society.
Among the particular friends ofVirgil, may be reckoned Horace, a distinguished
